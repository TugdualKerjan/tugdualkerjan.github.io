I sit in the train thinking
I have to scream it out
Not daring, self-censoring
Of fear of mispronouncing

The words I want to say
Are jumbled nebulae
Notably, notions and notes
On my terrible addiction

I need to push through
The pressure of taboo
As taboo is the reason
These problems lack compassion.

Even now in poem
Hidden from perception
I push myself to mention
And unveil porn addiction

Finally it's out.
