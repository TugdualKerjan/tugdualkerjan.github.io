The result is this sort of deck of cards,  each one describing something I find worth of sharing. It took a fullday for me to make the cards, animate and modularise them, without everhaving touched Javascript before. Quite satisfied."

Really intuitive, got a good grasp thanks to this fellow on YouTube: Imphenzia. I then decided to see if I could preview   it on a github page I had recently created (This one). After a solid day of work my shitty 3D model is viewable on a website from anywhere around the world!"
