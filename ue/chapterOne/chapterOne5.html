        <p class="dialogue-text">Clint the coworker takes the metro every day to get to work. The rhythmic clatter of
          the metro on the
          tracks,
          opening and closing of the doors, and the occasional screech of brakes hinder the experience of the ride.
          Overhead
          announcements, only auditive, providing information about the next stop might not be heard over his airpods.
          Certain passengers talk loud so as to hear each other over the noise to the annoyance of their neighboring
          travellers.

          Tourists, proffessionals and students crowd the metro at peak hours rendering it hard to find a place to sit
          down
          and start work early. The windows often give way to the darkness of the tunnel. The interior remains clean and
          dry
          as well as absent of signs of vandalism.</p>

        <p class="dialogue-text">Our persona is constantly working to provide for his family, even while going to and
          coming back from work. He
          constantly takes Lausanne's M2 to go to his different meetings, lunch with clients or fitness at the end of
          the
          day, working from his phone any time he's in the subway. The metro is a type of transportation that is
          cosmopolitan and open. Our persona wishes to make and answer phone calls in the metro but unfortunately can't
          find
          a silent place to do it.

          The people that surround him are strangers and he fails to see the value in exchanging with them for such a
          short
          period of time. Social norms allow him to work on his phone instead of interacting with his environment</p>

        <p class="dialogue-text"> Looking at this diagram, I gotta say, I'm impressed. It's clear a lot of thought went
          into addressing
          the
          issues commuters face. The idea of a reservation system for a quiet zone? That's smart. It'd give folks like
          me
          a
          chance to work without all the ruckus. And different class wagons, now that's an interesting twist for a metro
          system. Gives you options. Sometimes you just need that quiet space, a bit of division from the hustle and
          bustle.
          It's about making the ride better for everyone. I'm all for anything that makes the daily commute a little
          more
          bearable.

        <h4 class="dialogue-name">Clint:</h4>
        <p class="dialogue-text"> Alright, Tugdual. Let's zero in on the two solutions that we believe will make the
          most
          impact.
          <br>
          First up, we've got the insulated cabins. They're a game changer for anyone needing to buckle down and focus
          or
          make a call without the cacophony of the metro. They're like a quiet car on a train, except it's a cabin
          within the metro itself. It's a space that acknowledges the modern commuter's need to stay productive, even in
          transit.

        <h4 class="dialogue-name">Clint:</h4>
        <p class="dialogue-text"> Then there's the private phone booth. It's a compact, soundproof space providing a
          much-needed private spot for calls. We place these booths at the end of each car, ensuring easy access without
          disturbing the flow of passengers. It's about giving people a choice â€“ join the hustle, or step away for a
          moment of privacy.
