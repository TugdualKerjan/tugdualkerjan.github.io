          make a call without the cacophony of the metro. They're like a quiet car on a train, except it's a cabin

          much-needed private spot for calls. We place these booths at the end of each car, ensuring easy access without

        <p class="dialogue-text">Many white-collar workers are troubled by the tedious task of writing daily reports
          during their work. As a result, they have integrated the increasingly mature large language model into their
          daily lives, using AI to help them refine and write. A similar situation also arises among architects, who
          spend a significant amount of time on mundane details when completing their designs. Therefore, we hope to
          enable AI to assist architects in completing sketches competition.

          Architects can leverage AI to streamline modeling by providing basic ideas and 2D sketches. Even with minimal
          descriptions, like "a 1-meter-wide window on the kitchen wall," AI can complete the modeling process. This
          integration has the potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy in architecture.</p>

        <h4 class="dialogue-name">STRAY DOGS!</h4>
        <p class="dialogue-text">In Chisinau, Moldova, the prevalence of stray dogs is a pressing issue. These resilient
          animals navigate the city's streets, facing challenges like hunger and disease due to the lack of a
          comprehensive municipal strategy. Despite sporadic individual efforts to feed and care for them, the number of
          strays overwhelms these initiatives. The absence of larger animal control measures and economic constraints
          exacerbate the problem.
          The situation underscores the need for a balanced approach, combining humane treatment with effective
          population control. While some organisations advocate for spaying and neutering programs, limited funding
          poses a significant obstacle. Doctor Vet Moldova, a local animal welfare organisation, strives to implement a
          long-term, sustainable, and strategic dog population management programme, using the CNVR approach (Catch –
          Neuter – Vaccinate – Return).
          Stray dogs in Chisinau serve as a visible manifestation of broader societal challenges, highlighting the
          importance of collaborative efforts to ensure the well-being of both the community and its canine inhabitants.
          Chisinau has a mix of modern style flat roofs and historial buildings - old wooden buildings and those
          abandoned soviet era buildings. In recent years, many of these historial buildings have become abandonned due
          to a downturned economy.</p>

          In Chisinau, a significant number of stray dogs face severe loneliness and lack essential social interaction,
          leading to distressing emotional and behavioral issues.

          The proposed solution is a unique program where stray dogs are trained to become interactive guides at key
          Soviet-era buildings in Chisinau. This small, dedicated spaces within these historic sites where people can
          visit, interact with the dogs along the tour. This approach serves a dual purpose: it provides much-needed
          companionship for the dogs and offers a unique engaging historical experience for visitors.

          This idea not only honors the historical significance of Chisinau's Soviet-era architecture but also adds a
          new dimension of community engagement and animal welfare. It aims to strengthen the bond between residents and
          stray dogs, fostering a sense of care, companionship, and shared history.</p>

        <p class="dialogue-text">
          Stray dogs in Chisinau face increased dangers due to heavy traffic, resulting in accidents and injuries. The
          absence of infrastructure tailored to their safety exacerbates the vulnerability of these animals in the
          city's bustling environment.

          Implementing smart animal-safe crossings equipped with infrared sensors in key areas of Chisinau directly
          addresses the city's unique challenge. These crossings offer real-time detection of stray dogs like Shadow,
          ensuring adaptive traffic signals and visible alerts for enhanced safety.

          In Chisinau, where stray dog populations are notable, the introduction of these crossings holds particular
          significance. It reflects a proactive approach to animal welfare within the city's urban fabric, demonstrating
          a commitment to the safety and well-being of both residents and the vulnerable stray dog community.</p>

        <p class="dialogue-text">
          Chisinau's stray dogs struggle to find shelter during the city's cold winters, leading to health risks and
          disruption of the dogs in urban areas.

          The solution involves transforming Chisinau's flat rooftops into insulated, heated shelters for stray dogs.
          These rooftop refuges will be easily accessible and serve as safe havens during winter. To engage the
          community and enhance urban aesthetics, these shelters will feature art installations or murals and
          incorporate green spaces for natural insulation and exploration.

          This concept merges well with Chisinau's mix of historic and modern architecture. The shelters, designed to
          complement the city's look, use sustainable materials and green elements, supporting environmental goals. This
          initiative turns underused spaces into beneficial areas for strays, improving the urban landscape and
          fostering community care for animals.</p>

          Our goal with this project was to use the process of blending two images to reach back to a greener and
          livelier space. Akin to cooking, images are cut up with Midjourney by creating variations, blended together
          using the Blend tool, and spiced up by using external tools that have more accurate logic like Chat-GPT (Able
          to count better). Finally, they can be cooked: We ask Midjourney to describe the image and then generate a new
          image based on what Midjourney provided. The result is below, the recipe is on the next page.</p>

          The result of this process allows us to create a space full of life and voice. Students may sit in the shade
          if they wish, and structures are easy to disassemble for music festivals such as Balélec.

          Trees act as natural and efficient moist keepers, dust cleaners, air filters. The provide shade and a
          structure on which to place modular places to work in when the weather allows it. They serve as a natural
          barrier against wind, and create a safehaven for nature and it's animals. Trees, in summary, are the best
          thing an architect can draw.</p>
