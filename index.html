            <a class="desc">With Augustin decided it would be a good idea to bike all the way back from Lausanne to
                Lille by bike. Took a sore ass, 4 days of biking and one afternoon of traversing the Jura hungover to
                acheive this dumb idea. Left with just a backpack, no sleeping bag nor tent. Used WarmShowers to find
                places to sleep.</a>

            <p class="desc">After reseting my computer because I had accidentaly corrupted my Ubuntu, I was presented
                with the option to select a keyboard layout. I decided to go with Colemak, which had been specificaly
                designed to be more efficient at typing compared to Qwerty. Over the course of 2 weeks I went from 0 wpm
                to 50! I am currenty working on punctuation and coding, as those also rely on muscle memory.</p>

            <a class="desc">Bored on a saturday morning with Charles and Come, we decide that it is time we made a
                potato gun. Ingredients: Potato, PVC and lighter. Surprisingly powerful, especially given that less fuel
                gives a more potent explosion (Ratio of Oxygen?)</a>

            <a class="desc">The day after making the blender space ship I decided it was time to make a terrible website
                on which I would be able to log all the projects I enjoy investing time in. The result is this sort of
                deck of cards, each one describing something I find worth of sharing. It took a full day for me to make
                the cards, animate and modularise them, without ever having touched Javascript before. Quite
                satisfied.</a>

            <a class="desc">Drew some perspective drawing 2 days ago, wanted to see how it would look in Blender. Then
                spent the next day on learning how to use the application. Really intuitive, got a good grasp thanks to
                this fellow on YouTube: Imphenzia. I then decided to see if I could preview it on a github page I had
                recently created (This one). After a solid day of work my shitty 3D model is viewable on a website from
                anywhere around the world!</a>
