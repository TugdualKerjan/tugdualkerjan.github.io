                <a class="desc">With Augustin decided it would be a good idea to bike all the way back from Lausanne
                    to
                    Lille by bike. Took a sore ass, 4 days of biking and one afternoon of traversing the Jura
                    hungover to
                    acheive this dumb idea. Left with just a backpack, no sleeping bag nor tent. Used WarmShowers to
                    find
                    places to sleep.</a>

                <p class="desc">After reseting my computer because I had accidentaly corrupted my Ubuntu, I was
                    presented
                    with the option to select a keyboard layout. I decided to go with Colemak, which had been
                    specificaly
                    designed to be more efficient at typing compared to Qwerty. Over the course of 2 weeks I went
                    from 0 wpm
                    to 50! I am currenty working on punctuation and coding, as those also rely on muscle memory.</p>

                <a class="desc">Bored on a saturday morning with Charles and Come, we decide that it is time we made
                    a
                    potato gun. Ingredients: Potato, PVC and lighter. Surprisingly powerful, especially given that
                    less fuel
                    gives a more potent explosion (Ratio of Oxygen?)</a>

                <a class="desc">The day after making the blender space ship I decided it was time to make a terrible
                    website
                    on which I would be able to log all the projects I enjoy investing time in. The result is this
                    sort of
                    deck of cards, each one describing something I find worth of sharing. It took a full day for me
                    to make
                    the cards, animate and modularise them, without ever having touched Javascript before. Quite
                    satisfied.</a>

                <a class="desc">Drew some perspective drawing 2 days ago, wanted to see how it would look in
                    Blender. Then
                    spent the next day on learning how to use the application. Really intuitive, got a good
                    grasp thanks to
                    this fellow on YouTube: Imphenzia. I then decided to see if I could preview it on a github
                    page I had
                    recently created (This one). After a solid day of work my shitty 3D model is viewable on a
                    website from
                    anywhere around the world!</a>
