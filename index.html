With the help of a very large metal frame that was laying around we decided to make a raft with some friends. We then went to the lake to test it out. There was enough buoyancy for a total of 7 people on it! Doors of metal lockers were used without much efficiency to paddle around. An overall success :)</p>

        <p class="desc" >The second deck I chose to work on after the World countries one 							is dedicated to the periodic table of elements, namely the name, 							atomic number and symbol. It took me 1 month to learn, 10 minutes 							a day. This confirmed the efficiency of Anki which I since then 							use to store notes about classes and programming. This also 							introduced me to the art of memory as it used small images 							associated to each element so as to help the learning process.</p>
