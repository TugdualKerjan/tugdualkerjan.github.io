                        <a class="desc">Once again bored during quarantine and having completed the DARPA Potato Canon,
                            I wanted to go a little further. The obvious answer is building rockets, so after a little
                            research and the wonderfully documented blog of Richard Nakka, I decided to go for the
                            classic potassium nitrate (KNO3) + sugar rockets. Just like your car, your rocket needs
                            oxygen and a fuel. Instead of using petrol we will use sugar, and instead of using the
                            oxygen of the atmosphere we will grab them from the potassium nitrate. We grabbed some
                            sodium nitrate from the gardening store and some potassium chloride from the pharmacy (A
                            common replacement for salt). Did a double displacement reaction and ended up with our long
                            awaited for potassium nitrate. Some tests reveal flamboyant success, and, don't tell mom but
                            when mixing another batch later on it exploded and my hair burt to a crisp. Thankfully I was
                            wearing goggles and a mask, so my moustache is intact.</a>

                            the process of editing each name. I started by downloading a csv with all the elements and
                            their numbers, then designing the basic template token in inkscape, then using a python
                            program to copy paste and change the number, symbol and name and paste the elements one next

                        <a class="desc">Using the opensource application ANKI, I was able in the span of a month, 20
                            minutes a day, to memorise all countries, capitals, geolocations and flags. This totaled to
                            around 10 hours of work. It also allowed me to realise the potential of Anki. I have used it
                            since to memorize a multitude of other subjects that you can find in other cards. As a side
                            note, I chose to also memorise the cantons of Switzerland, their capital and coat of arms,
                            as well as the regions of France.</a>
