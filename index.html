                            month to learn, 10 minutes a day. This confirmed the efficiency of Anki which I since then
                            use to store notes about classes and programming. This also introduced me to the art of
                            memory as it used small images associated to each element so as to help the learning
                            process.</a>

                            The result is this sort of deck of cards, each one describing something I find worth of
                            sharing. It took a full day for me to make the cards, animate and modularise them, without
                            ever having touched Javascript before. Quite satisfied.</a>

                            could preview it on a github page I had recently created (This one). After a solid day of

                            around 10 hours of work. It also allowed me to realise the potential of Anki. I have used it
                            since to memorize a multitude of other subjects that you can find in other cards. As a side
                            note, I chose to also memorise the cantons of Switzerland, their capital and coat of arms,
